## What is Watson assistant? 
Watson Assistant is the industry-leading conversational AI technology powering chatbots. It is IBM’s AI product that lets you build, train, and deploy conversational interactions into any application, device, or channel.

Most chatbots try to mimic human interactions, which can frustrate users when a misunderstanding arises. Watson Assistant is more. It knows when to search for an answer from a knowledge base, when to ask for clarity and when to direct users to a human. Watson Assistant can be deployed in any cloud or on-premises environment – meaning smarter AI is finally available wherever you need it.
